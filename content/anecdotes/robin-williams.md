I've been on somewhat of a **Robin Williams** marathon recently.
Personal highlights include *World's Greatest Dad*, *Fisher King* and *The Birdcage*.
If you like Robin Williams but have only seen his classics like Mrs. Doubtfire and Dead Poets Society,
then be sure to check those out. And if you don't like Robin Williams, well... get a therapist?
